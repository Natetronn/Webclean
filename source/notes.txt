Note: anything larger than around 921k for the background image doesn't seem to work. 1.3MB image didn't work, anyway. I tried using an svg as well, as it was only 22k, for kicks and giggle to see what would happen but, that didn't work, of course. Must be a .bmp filetype, it seems. If anyone knows how to edit the bios to accept other filetypes let me know.

imagemagick cmd: convert -quality 100 ./source/webclean-skin-bg.jpg ./webclean-skin-bg.bmp
