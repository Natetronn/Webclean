Note: anything larger than around 921k for the background image doesn't seem to work. 1.3MB image didn't work, anyway. I tried using an svg as well, as it was only 22k, for kicks and giggle to see what would happen but, that didn't work, of course. Must be a .bmp filetype, it seems. If anyone knows how to edit the bios to accept other filetypes let me know.

First use Trimage Image Compressor, or similar, on the PNG. Then convert to BMP using the following:

imagemagick cmd: convert -quality 100 [image-path].jpg [image-path].bmp
